// Create a number guessing game with difficulty levels and score tracking

/*
The plan is to create 5 levels of difficulty and there will be a "prize" for each 
level completed.
IDK what the prize is yet I'll figure it out
but I do know that all the main should do is call the guessing function
then I'll have a difficult function
then call both in main
oh yeah, and a prize function
so it should loop you in the level state until you guess the number
LV1 = 1 - 10
LV2 = 1 - 50
LV3 = 1 - 100
LV4 = 1 - 500
LV5 = 1 - 1000
The score tracker should also be another function that takes the string output 
for every "wrong answer" and counts the amount of times it took to guess right
